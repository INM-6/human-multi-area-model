# fMRI data

This folder contains the experimental fMRI data for comparing the functional connectivity matrices. `./rsData_7T_DKparcel` contains two files: one with the 68 cortical regions of interest (ROIs), and the other with the average blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal for each ROI obtained as the mean of the time-series of its constituent voxels.

The MRI data were obtained from nineteen participants (7 female, age range = 21â€“33 years, mean age = 25 years) with normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity.
Anatomical and functional images were acquired at Maastricht Brain Imaging Centre (Maastricht University) on a whole-body Magnetom 7T research scanner (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) using a 32-channel head-coil (Nova Medical Inc.; Wilmington, MA, USA). All participants provided written informed consent after receiving full information about experimental procedures and were compensated for participation through either monetary reward or course credit. All procedures were conducted with approval from the local Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University.
