# Ratio of excitatory to inhibitory cells

There are two datasets on the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory cells that can
currently be chosen.

## lichtman.csv

Data extracted from [Shapson-Coe et al. (2021) bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.29.446289v3.full.pdf), supplementary figure 5, using [WebPlotDigitizer](https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/).

Layer II (ratio 0.65) and III (ratio 0.64) are averaged for the layer II/III value.

## binzegger.csv

Values taken from from [Potjans & Diesmann 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23203991/) and calculated from these fractions:

```
fraction_E_neurons = [
    20683. / (20683. + 5834.),
    21915. / (21915. + 5479.),
    4850. / (4850. + 1065.),
    14395. / (14395. + 2948.)
]
```
